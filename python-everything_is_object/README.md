1. An object in Python is a self-contained entity that combines data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (methods or functions) into a single unit. Objects can interact with each other by invoking methods or accessing attributes, and they can also be created, modified, and destroyed dynamically during program execution.

2. A class is a blueprint that defines the attributes and behaviors of objects. An object, or instance, is a specific realization of a class.

3. Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation, while mutable objects can be modified.

4. A reference in Python is a value that points to an object in memory, allowing you to access and manipulate that object.

5. In Python, an assignment associates a value with a variable using the "=" operator. It allows you to store and manipulate values by referencing the variable.

6. In Python, an alias is a different name referring to the same object or variable. It allows multiple names to be used interchangeably to access the same underlying value.

7. In Python, you can use the is operator to check if two variables are identical, meaning they refer to the exact same object in memory.

8. To check if two variables are linked to the same object in Python, you can use the is operator.

9. To display the memory address (variable identifier) of an object in Python, you can use the id() function.

10. Mutable objects can be changed after creation, while immutable objects cannot be modified once created.

11. The built-in mutable types in Python are lists, dictionaries, sets, and bytearrays.

12. The built-in immutable types in Python include integers, floats, strings, tuples, and frozensets.

13. In Python, variables are passed to functions by reference. Changes made to the object within the function will affect the original object. Reassigning the parameter within the function will not affect the original variable.
