    1. Selecting HTML Elements in JavaScript:
        Use methods like getElementById, getElementsByClassName, getElementsByTagName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll.

    2. Differences Between ID, Class, and Tag Name Selectors:
        ID selectors select unique elements by their id attribute.
        Class selectors select elements by their class attribute.
        Tag name selectors select elements by their HTML tag name.

    3. Modifying an HTML Element's Style:
        Modify an element's style using its style property.

    4. Getting and Updating an HTML Element's Content:
        Get content with innerHTML or textContent.
        Update content by assigning new values to these properties.

    5. Modifying the DOM (Document Object Model):
        Manipulate the DOM by creating, appending, or removing elements.

    6. Making a Request with XmlHTTPRequest:
        Use XMLHttpRequest to make HTTP requests and handle responses.

    7. Making a Request with Fetch API:
        Use the modern fetch API for HTTP requests.

    8. Listening/Binding to DOM Events:
        Use addEventListener to listen for DOM events like clicks and changes.

    9. Listening/Binding to User Events:
        Handle user events (e.g., button clicks) similarly with addEventListener.
