OPP = stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that organizes and structures code around objects, which are instances of classes. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects and allows for the encapsulation of data (attributes) and behavior (methods) within those objects.

The key concepts of OOP include:

    Classes: Classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects. They define the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have.

    Objects: Objects are instances of classes. They represent specific instances of a class and can have their own unique data and behavior.

    Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit (object). It allows for data hiding and protecting data integrity.

    Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.

    Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of different implementations for the same method across different classes.

    Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on providing simplified interfaces to interact with objects. It allows for hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features.
